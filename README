1. Installation instructions:
-----------------------------
In order to use this program you need python version 2.6.
You need to install pysage: http://code.google.com/p/pysage .

=====================================================================

2. Usage
--------
The program currently runs 500 iterations of 100 games and summarizes
the result.
All games are played with 1 player against a dealer.

It takes up to two arguments:
	- the first argument specifies the type of the player that will
		play. It can be one of the following:
		- human - for human player
		- SARSA - for the SARSA player - the self-learning player
		- probability - for the Probability AI player
		- HiLo - for the card-counting player
		- basic - for the player using the basic strategy
	- the second argument is optional. If it is present or the player
		is a human player - the simple (console) UI is started and a
		better log about the game is outputted.
The game plays the iterations of hands and then summarizes the
results. It creates a file called statistics that contains a line for
each iteration - the number of games won by the player in these 100 
games.
